To build the 'bubble_demo.c' application simply run the 'build_bubble_demo.sh'
shell script.  That will compile the 'bubble_demo.c' source file and produce the
executable 'bubble_demo' application.  Refer to the 'build_bubble_demo.sh'
script to see how the application is actually compiled and refer to the C
program source file for more details on how it actually works.

Once you've built the application, you can run the applications like this:

./bubble_demo
